class httpConfig(object):

	'''
	Class for the http config component of the C2 profile.

	Profile options include:
	- Server (this can be overridden in sub-components, in fact, the stager will
	  almost always have a varied server to avoid blue teams linking stager to redirector)
	- Trust_X_Forwarded_for (you could add this in if you want)

	From CS documentation (https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2):
	"The set trust_x_forwarded_for option decides if Cobalt Strike uses the X-Forwarded-For 
	HTTP header to determine the remote address of a request. Use this option if your 
	Cobalt Strike server is behind an HTTP redirector."

	We've left it out and haven't had any issues. Guessing the default is fine.
